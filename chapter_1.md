# Chapter 1: Clues from the Past

#### You probably picked up this book because you want to make money in the stock market.

Let's look at how money has been made in the stock market in the past: 2 very different methods have been used:
1. Betting on the business cycle
  - People made a lot of money if they knew when to buy at low times and sell at high, based on recurring "boom-and-bust" bank cycles
  - This was largely thanks to insider information/trading
  - Also, some legislation was passed to make this method harder (because it increased stability and made insider trading illegal)
2. Finding really outstanding companies and staying with them through market fluctuations
  - If done right, this method makes more money, with less risk
  - Case in point: at time of writing (1950's) there are "scores" of stocks with at least 25x growth over a period of 25-50 years.
    - So, if you can pick a couple of these, and have some years to wait, then you win.

> "These opportunities did not require purchasing on a particular day at the bottom of a great panic. The shares of these companies were available year after year at prices that were to make this kind of profit possible. What was required was the ability to distinguish these relatively few companies with outstanding investment possibilities from the much greatter number whose future would vary all the way from moderately successful to complete failure."

#### Opportunities of today are even better than those of the past. This is because:

1. There used to be nepotism, and not as high of a drive to be uber successful. And even when there was, the management would keep much of the profits for themselves.
- This still happens, but less so today.

2. R&D is something that is growing and growing. This has impacts on investors because (1) it can greatly advance products and markets, and (2) it means that companies that handle expenditures smartly and efficiently will vastly outperform those who do not.
  - Some research efforts will inevitably miss (even at the best companies)
  - research efforts may take 1-15 years to "pay off", and until then can be a big financial drain.
  - Watch out for (1) poorly organized research, and (2) too little research.
  - Of the companies who can perform adequate research efficiently and effectively: "Their fortunate stockholders, rather than the proverbial meek, may well inherit the earth."

3. \[I don't understand this one as well\], post-war and post-depression legislation changes (like income tax, and different responses to a future depression) will make depressing or poor business cycles shorter and less pronounced for companies that are already intrinsically financially strong.

#### Also, bonds are not as good of an investment as common stocks (or, as good as they used to be) (at least in the 1950's).

- When large governments take on debt, they expand the global base of credit.
- This in turn creates "wholesale expansions of credit"
- This produces inflation
- This makes bonds worth less because their earnings are based on a fixed dollar (or other currency) value

#### The past tells us:
- The greatest investment reward comes from finding the company that can "over the years grow in sales and profits far more than industry as a whole".
- When we believe we have found such a company, we had better stick with it for a long time.
- Such companies need not be young and small.
- Management must have a determination to attain further growth, and te ability to bring its plans to completion.
